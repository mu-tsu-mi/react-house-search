# My House Search Tool

Thanks for visiting My House Search app. An app that has both Domain's property information and user's notes.
I came up with this idea when I was frustrated not seeing all the information I cared about was not in one place.

## For fellow developersðŸ‘‹ -->

This app uses local storage. The data is fetched from Domain website.
I am currently using CORS anywhere so please enable cors anywhere first through the following url:
https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo

### Scripts

I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Please use the following.
development mode: npm start
test: npm test
Build the app for production: npm run build
